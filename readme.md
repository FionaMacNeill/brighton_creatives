> Using the government's official economic measure of Gross Value Added (GVA) in chained volume measures, the creative industries grew more than twice as fast in 2022 as the UK economy as a whole. Since 2010, the creative industries have expanded according to this measure by 50.3 per cent, compared to the UK economy's average increase of 21.5 per cent during the same period. Creative industries account for 5.7 per cent of total UK GVA.

> 
> The largest contributions to the increase in creative Industries GVA from 2021 to 2022 were the ‘IT, software and computer services’ subsector, the ‘Publishing’ subsector and the ‘Film, TV, video, radio and photography’ subsector, which grew by 7.3 per cent, 10.1 per cent and 5.4 per cent respectively. All segments of the creative industries grew their GVA from 2021 to 2022, apart from the crafts subsector, which fell by 6.8 per cent.

Based on the provided sources, here is information regarding the status of the UK's creative industries, including specifics on Brighton and how it compares to the national picture.

**National Status of UK Creative Industries and Cultural Sector**

The creative industries are considered by the government to be "world-leading, an engine of our economic growth". The management consulting firm McKinsey and Company also described the UK as a "cultural powerhouse" in November 2023. The government published a 'Creative industries sector vision' in June 2023, which included a commitment to an additional £77mn in funding. This vision aims to turbo-charge growth in the sector by leveraging the UK's global technological leadership.

In terms of economic contribution:
*   The government estimates that the creative industries generated **£126bn in gross value added (GVA)** to the economy in 2022. This was 12% higher in real terms than in 2019, while the UK economy as a whole grew by only 2% over the same period.
*   More recent figures show the GVA of the Creative Industries was estimated at **£123.03bn** between January and December 2024, representing 5.37% of total UK GVA.
*   The Cultural Sector, which overlaps with the creative industries, had an estimated GVA of **£34bn** in 2022, which was 5% higher in real terms than in 2019. Between January and December 2024, the Cultural Sector GVA was estimated at **£32.97bn**, or 1.44% of total UK GVA.

For employment:
*   The government estimates that the creative industries employed **2.4 million people** across the UK in 2022. This represented a 49% increase since 2011. From July 2023 to June 2024, the Creative Industries employed **2.40 million workers**, making up 7.06% of the UK workforce.
*   The Cultural Sector employed an estimated **703,000 people** between July 2022 and June 2023. From July 2023 to June 2024, the cultural sector employed **695,000 workers**, or 2.04% of the UK workforce.
*   Workers in the Creative Industries and Cultural Sector have a higher proportion of self-employed individuals compared to the wider UK workforce.

In terms of businesses:
*   In 2024, there were **268,080 Creative Industries businesses** in the UK, which is the equivalent of 9.84% of all UK businesses.

The UK creative industries also have a significant global presence:
*   In 2020, the UK was the **fifth largest exporter of creative services** globally, worth $57bn, and the seventh largest exporter of creative goods ($15bn).
*   In 2021, the Creative Industries had a **trade surplus of £2.1bn in goods**. They exported £9.1bn of goods and imported £7bn.
*   Also in 2021, the Creative Industries had a substantial **trade surplus of £18.7bn in services**. Businesses in this sector exported £45.6bn of services and imported £26.9bn. The Cultural Sector had a services trade surplus of £4.0bn, with £9.3bn in exports and £5.3bn in imports in 2021. Overall, the Creative Industries registered a net export figure of **£20.87bn** in 2021.
*   Exports of services by businesses in DCMS sectors (including creative industries) have consistently been higher than imports between 2016 and 2021. Trade in services by businesses in the creative industries accounted for 14.6% of UK service exports and 15.2% of UK service imports in 2021. These proportions increased between 2019 and 2021.
*   The largest destination for DCMS sector service exports in 2021 was the USA (£17.6bn), followed by Germany (£3.7bn). For imports, the USA (£7.9bn) was the largest source, followed by India (£3.0bn). Creative industries businesses were the largest exporters and importers of services among DCMS sectors for these top partner countries.

Beyond economics, the arts and creative industries are recognized for wider impacts, including positively impacting wellbeing.

**Regional Distribution**

Regarding the regional distribution of creative industries businesses in the UK in 2024:
*   There were 140,815 creative businesses in **London and South East England**, accounting for 52.53% of all creative businesses.
*   There were 106,640 creative businesses in England outside of London and South East England, accounting for 39.78%.
*   The remaining businesses are in the Devolved Nations.

For cultural sector businesses in 2024, there is a visual representation showing a lower concentration in London and South East England and a higher concentration in the "Rest of England" compared to creative industries businesses.

Between 2022 and 2023, employee numbers in Great Britain increased in 10 out of 11 English regions and countries, with the East Midlands being the only region showing a decrease. The East of England saw the second largest percentage increase in employees (up 2.1%), after the North East (3.1%).

**Status in Brighton and East Sussex**

Brighton is described as having a **"thriving arts scene"** and **"innovative industries"**, having long been a **"hub for people with big ideas and bold visions"**. The city is seen as having a **global reputation** and being perfectly positioned to think both globally and locally.

However, despite this reputation and being described as a "powerhouse", a debate on the topic highlighted significant vulnerabilities and challenges:
*   **Visibility:** Brighton's creative achievements are often hidden or exported, meaning the city doesn't always receive the credit it deserves. There is a call for increased visibility, suggesting public spaces could be transformed into cultural showcases.
*   **Space:** Brighton has experienced a significant loss of affordable creative spaces since the COVID-19 pandemic. Without places to work, collaborate, and showcase talent, the city risks losing its creative professionals.
*   **Funding and Collaboration:** Contributions from developers via planning obligations are often viewed as a "tick-box exercise". Stronger, more meaningful partnerships between businesses, developers, and artists are needed to provide sustained support for grassroots initiatives.
*   **Inclusivity:** While Brighton has a reputation for inclusivity, opportunities can sometimes favor individuals from more privileged backgrounds. There is a recognized gap between academic preparation and the realities of professional creative careers that needs bridging to ensure everyone has equal opportunity.

The perception is that Brighton's creative sector, despite being a vibrant powerhouse and the soul of the city, **"isn’t always valued as it should be"**. This lack of recognition is seen as potentially stalling creative momentum and jeopardizing the city's economic future.

**Comparison to the National Picture**

Nationally, the creative industries are clearly recognized at a high level for their significant and growing economic contribution, job creation, and positive trade balance, with the government investing in growth and talent. The government's vision includes goals like growing creative clusters and maximizing wider impacts.

In contrast, the perspective from Brighton, while acknowledging the sector's vibrancy and powerhouse potential, points to local challenges around visibility, affordable physical space, the need for more effective funding partnerships, and addressing inclusivity gaps. These local issues suggest that despite the positive national trends and the concentration of creative businesses in the South East, specific areas like Brighton may face unique pressures (such as loss of space since COVID) and feel that their local contribution is undervalued compared to their potential. Solutions discussed locally, such as creating affordable spaces, strengthening partnerships, and embedding creativity in city planning, align with some broader national goals like growing clusters and maximizing positive impact, but highlight the need for specific, localized action.
