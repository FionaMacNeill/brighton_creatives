Based on the provided sources, here is information regarding the status of the UK's creative industries, including specifics on Brighton and how it compares to the national picture.

**National Status of UK Creative Industries and Cultural Sector**

The creative industries are considered by the government to be "world-leading, an engine of our economic growth". The management consulting firm McKinsey and Company also described the UK as a "cultural powerhouse" in November 2023. The government published a 'Creative industries sector vision' in June 2023, which included a commitment to an additional £77mn in funding. This vision aims to turbo-charge growth in the sector by leveraging the UK's global technological leadership.

In terms of economic contribution:
*   The government estimates that the creative industries generated **£126bn in gross value added (GVA)** to the economy in 2022. This was 12% higher in real terms than in 2019, while the UK economy as a whole grew by only 2% over the same period.
*   More recent figures show the GVA of the Creative Industries was estimated at **£123.03bn** between January and December 2024, representing 5.37% of total UK GVA.
*   The Cultural Sector, which overlaps with the creative industries, had an estimated GVA of **£34bn** in 2022, which was 5% higher in real terms than in 2019. Between January and December 2024, the Cultural Sector GVA was estimated at **£32.97bn**, or 1.44% of total UK GVA.

For employment:
*   The government estimates that the creative industries employed **2.4 million people** across the UK in 2022. This represented a 49% increase since 2011. From July 2023 to June 2024, the Creative Industries employed **2.40 million workers**, making up 7.06% of the UK workforce.
*   The Cultural Sector employed an estimated **703,000 people** between July 2022 and June 2023. From July 2023 to June 2024, the cultural sector employed **695,000 workers**, or 2.04% of the UK workforce.
*   Workers in the Creative Industries and Cultural Sector have a higher proportion of self-employed individuals compared to the wider UK workforce.

In terms of businesses:
*   In 2024, there were **268,080 Creative Industries businesses** in the UK, which is the equivalent of 9.84% of all UK businesses.

The UK creative industries also have a significant global presence:
*   In 2020, the UK was the **fifth largest exporter of creative services** globally, worth $57bn, and the seventh largest exporter of creative goods ($15bn).
*   In 2021, the Creative Industries had a **trade surplus of £2.1bn in goods**. They exported £9.1bn of goods and imported £7bn.
*   Also in 2021, the Creative Industries had a substantial **trade surplus of £18.7bn in services**. Businesses in this sector exported £45.6bn of services and imported £26.9bn. The Cultural Sector had a services trade surplus of £4.0bn, with £9.3bn in exports and £5.3bn in imports in 2021. Overall, the Creative Industries registered a net export figure of **£20.87bn** in 2021.
*   Exports of services by businesses in DCMS sectors (including creative industries) have consistently been higher than imports between 2016 and 2021. Trade in services by businesses in the creative industries accounted for 14.6% of UK service exports and 15.2% of UK service imports in 2021. These proportions increased between 2019 and 2021.
*   The largest destination for DCMS sector service exports in 2021 was the USA (£17.6bn), followed by Germany (£3.7bn). For imports, the USA (£7.9bn) was the largest source, followed by India (£3.0bn). Creative industries businesses were the largest exporters and importers of services among DCMS sectors for these top partner countries.

Beyond economics, the arts and creative industries are recognized for wider impacts, including positively impacting wellbeing.

**Regional Distribution**

Regarding the regional distribution of creative industries businesses in the UK in 2024:
*   There were 140,815 creative businesses in **London and South East England**, accounting for 52.53% of all creative businesses.
*   There were 106,640 creative businesses in England outside of London and South East England, accounting for 39.78%.
*   The remaining businesses are in the Devolved Nations.

For cultural sector businesses in 2024, there is a visual representation showing a lower concentration in London and South East England and a higher concentration in the "Rest of England" compared to creative industries businesses.

Between 2022 and 2023, employee numbers in Great Britain increased in 10 out of 11 English regions and countries, with the East Midlands being the only region showing a decrease. The East of England saw the second largest percentage increase in employees (up 2.1%), after the North East (3.1%).

**Status in Brighton and East Sussex**

Brighton is described as having a **"thriving arts scene"** and **"innovative industries"**, having long been a **"hub for people with big ideas and bold visions"**. The city is seen as having a **global reputation** and being perfectly positioned to think both globally and locally.

However, despite this reputation and being described as a "powerhouse", a debate on the topic highlighted significant vulnerabilities and challenges:
*   **Visibility:** Brighton's creative achievements are often hidden or exported, meaning the city doesn't always receive the credit it deserves. There is a call for increased visibility, suggesting public spaces could be transformed into cultural showcases.
*   **Space:** Brighton has experienced a significant loss of affordable creative spaces since the COVID-19 pandemic. Without places to work, collaborate, and showcase talent, the city risks losing its creative professionals.
*   **Funding and Collaboration:** Contributions from developers via planning obligations are often viewed as a "tick-box exercise". Stronger, more meaningful partnerships between businesses, developers, and artists are needed to provide sustained support for grassroots initiatives.
*   **Inclusivity:** While Brighton has a reputation for inclusivity, opportunities can sometimes favor individuals from more privileged backgrounds. There is a recognized gap between academic preparation and the realities of professional creative careers that needs bridging to ensure everyone has equal opportunity.

The perception is that Brighton's creative sector, despite being a vibrant powerhouse and the soul of the city, **"isn’t always valued as it should be"**. This lack of recognition is seen as potentially stalling creative momentum and jeopardizing the city's economic future.

**Comparison to the National Picture**

Nationally, the creative industries are clearly recognized at a high level for their significant and growing economic contribution, job creation, and positive trade balance, with the government investing in growth and talent. The government's vision includes goals like growing creative clusters and maximizing wider impacts.

In contrast, the perspective from Brighton, while acknowledging the sector's vibrancy and powerhouse potential, points to local challenges around visibility, affordable physical space, the need for more effective funding partnerships, and addressing inclusivity gaps. These local issues suggest that despite the positive national trends and the concentration of creative businesses in the South East, specific areas like Brighton may face unique pressures (such as loss of space since COVID) and feel that their local contribution is undervalued compared to their potential. Solutions discussed locally, such as creating affordable spaces, strengthening partnerships, and embedding creativity in city planning, align with some broader national goals like growing clusters and maximizing positive impact, but highlight the need for specific, localized action.


## on the question of comparison against other municipalitiesm specifically:

Based on the sources provided, it's not possible to provide a direct, comprehensive financial comparison of Brighton & Hove City Council's spending on creative industries against specific financial figures for all other UK municipalities. The sources focusing on UK councils generally provide aggregated data or highlight the overall trend of funding cuts across England.

However, the sources do offer insights into how Brighton & Hove City Council supports its creative industries and the broader context of local government funding for culture in the UK.

- Brighton & Hove City Council's Support for Creative Industries:
    + Brighton & Hove is highlighted as an internationally known centre of creativity and one of the UK's most dynamic and innovative creative clusters. The city's creative identity is seen as rooted in its history and built upon its grassroots music scene. Arts, culture, and creativity are considered essential to the city's identity. The city is home to hundreds of artists and creative producers. The creative and visitor economies are recognised as two of the city's biggest economic contributors.
    + Brighton & Hove City Council has a dedicated Culture & Creative Industries team. This team supports the arts industry by championing strengths, facilitating strategic projects, mobilizing the council's convening power, advocating for the central role of the arts in city life and the economy (including through planning, licensing, economic development analysis, and wider strategies), and consulting and collaborating with stakeholders, funders, and private-sector champions. They also work to preserve and encourage cultural activity by working with artists, venues, and the wider creative sector on operational risks, funding, professional development, and strategic investment.

- Specific initiatives mentioned include:
    • Culture In Our City website as a one-stop shop for information and exchange.
    • The Brighton & Hove Culture Alliance, supported by the council (among others), which promotes collaboration across the creative sector, aims to create more and fairer opportunities, and advocates for the sector. The Alliance grew out of the ABCD Cultural Recovery Programme.
    • The ABCD Cultural Recovery Programme, which ran from April 2021 to December 2022 in response to COVID-19. Supported by the council, among other core funders, this program raised over £500k for creative projects and brought the cultural and creative sectors together. It aimed to restart the cultural economy and build a better future, addressing challenges and opportunities.
    • Development of a new 10-year Creative Destination Vision & Strategy. This strategy is commissioned and funded by the council and co-created with stakeholders. It aims to align with the new Economic Strategy and enhance the city's identity as a leading creative coastal city. A goal is for a clear step change in ambition to be recognised as the best creative small city in the UK.
    • Support for the grassroots music scene, including working with the Music Venues Trust to produce a planning guide. This guide affirms commitment to the 'Agent of Change' principle in planning policy to protect venues from sensitive new developments. The council recognises music venues as a key part of the city's economic and social fabric and nighttime economy.

The council also actively seeks input from the creative sector for its long-term city plan, aiming to ensure the sector is fully recognised and embedded in the city's future. The "Big Debate" source highlights challenges within Brighton's creative sector, such as the loss of affordable creative spaces, the need for better alignment of funding and partnerships (developer contributions are mentioned but sometimes seen as a "tick-box exercise"), and inclusivity issues. This suggests that while the council has strategic support mechanisms, practical challenges remain.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Brighton & Hove City Council highlighted the severe impact on its arts, culture, events, creative industries, and tourism sectors, noting that the city is a "cultural powerhouse". They advocated for Local Authorities to play a central role in recovery efforts, recognising the importance of place. They reported freelancers falling through support gaps and the loss of important grassroots organisations.

- Comparison with other UK Municipalities: The sources provide a general overview of the state of local government funding for culture across England, rather than comparative data for individual councils:
    • Local authorities are described as the largest single public funder of culture in England.
    • However, analysis shows that local government culture spending per person in England has been cut by more than 50% in real terms since 2009-10. Spending on museums, galleries, and libraries has shrunk significantly.
    • Councils face fast-growing financial pressures and significant funding gaps, driven primarily by rising demand and costs in statutory services like social care. This leaves less funding available for other services, including culture.
    • The real terms reduction in councils' "core spending power" was 24% between 2010/11 and 2024/25.
    • While one source initially mentions some councils proposed 100% cuts, a more nuanced statement clarifies that no council has made 100% cuts to culture, but what they deliver is changing, and grants to community groups and local cultural organisations have seen significant reductions. This causes challenges and uncertainty for the sector and risks freelancers leaving.
    • Councils are legally required to set balanced budgets, which can promote risk-averse decisions and make multi-year grant commitments difficult.
    • Councils need recognition of the funding pressure they face and support from the cultural sector in lobbying the government for stabilized funding.

In summary, while specific financial comparisons are not available, the sources indicate that Brighton & Hove City Council demonstrates a strong strategic focus and commitment to its creative industries, viewing them as vital to the city's identity, economy, and future, and supporting them through dedicated teams, strategies, alliances, and specific policy actions like planning guidance for music venues. This is presented against a national backdrop where English councils collectively have seen a drastic reduction in their cultural spending over the past decade due to severe financial pressures and rising demand for statutory services, leading to significant cuts in grants and changes in service delivery models across the country. Brighton's detailed efforts and stated ambition appear proactive compared to the general picture of reduced capacity and funding struggles presented for other councils.

These figures paint a picture of a creative sector that is a significant contributor to the UK economy, despite facing substantial cuts in local government and central government funding for culture over the past decade and challenges related to touring in the EU post-Brexit. Recent government announcements indicate a significant investment package aimed at addressing infrastructure needs and supporting various cultural institutions.
